    <h1>Privacy Policy – PadelScore</h1>
    <p>Last updated: 2025-09-18</p>
  </header>
  <main>
    <section>
      <p>PadelScore is a mobile and Wear OS app used to keep track of padel matches, scores, and match history, and (optionally) sign in with a user account. This Privacy Policy explains what data we process, why we process it, and how you can exercise your rights.</p>
      <div class="note">Short version: we store your match data on your device. If you sign in, some data may be synchronized to the cloud (Firebase). We do not sell your data.</div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>1) Data Controller & Contact</h2>
      <p>The data controller for the PadelScore app is the app publisher.</p>
      <p>Contact: <a href="mailto:poulain.louis12@gmail.com">poulain.louis12@gmail.com</a> .</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>2) What data we process</h2>
      <ul class="list-dash">
        <li>Match data (on-device): team names, set/game scores, timestamps, and optional duration. By default this remains on your device.</li>
        <li>Account data , Firebase processes identifiers such as email address, display name, and authentication tokens.</li>
        <li>Cloud data (optional): if cloud sync is enabled, match summaries may be stored in <em>Firebase Cloud Firestore</em> under your account.</li>
        <li>Diagnostics (optional): app usage metrics and crash logs if <em>Firebase Analytics / Crashlytics</em> are enabled in your build; these help us improve stability and features.</li>
        <li>Wear OS communication: the app uses Google Play Services (Wearable Data Layer) to send match snapshots between phone and watch. This link is used only to sync your match information between your own devices.</li>
        <li>Device data: basic technical information (device model, OS version, app version) may be processed for diagnostics and security.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>3) Why we process data (purposes & legal bases)</h2>
      <ul class="list-dash">
        <li>Provide core features: record and display match scores and history (contract/performance of the app).</li>
        <li>Sync across devices: if you sign in, store and retrieve your match summaries from Firestore (contract; legitimate interest to provide continuity across devices).</li>
        <li>Authentication & security: manage accounts, sessions, and fraud prevention via Firebase Auth (legitimate interest and/or contract).</li>
        <li>Analytics and crash reports (if enabled): improve stability and understand feature usage (legitimate interest). You can opt out at the OS level or within the app if such a control is provided.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>4) Data sharing & processors</h2>
      <p>We do not sell your personal data. We share data only with service providers who act as processors:</p>
      <ul class="list-dash">
        <li>Google Firebase (Authentication, Cloud Firestore, Analytics/Crashlytics) – infrastructure, storage, analytics, and security.</li>
        <li>Google Play Services (Wearable) – device-to-device transport between your phone and your watch.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These processors act under our instructions and according to their own privacy terms. Data may be processed on servers located outside your country. Standard contractual clauses (SCCs) may apply for international transfers.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>5) Retention</h2>
      <ul class="list-dash">
        <li>On-device match data: kept until you delete it or uninstall the app.</li>
        <li>Cloud data (if enabled): retained until you delete it from your account or request deletion.</li>
        <li>Account data: retained while your account is active. Once deleted, Firebase will remove associated data after a reasonable period as per their policies.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>6) Your rights</h2>
      <p>Subject to local laws (e.g., GDPR in the EU), you may have the right to access, correct, delete, or export your data, and to object to or restrict processing.</p>
      <ul class="list-dash">
        <li>In-app: you can clear match history or uninstall the app to remove local data.</li>
        <li>Account deletion: if you signed in, you can delete your account from within the app (Settings &gt; Account &gt; Delete account). If you cannot access the app, contact us at <a href="mailto:poulain.louis12@gmail.com">poulain.louis12@gmail.com</a>.</li>
        <li>Analytics opt-out: use your device settings (Ads or Privacy) or the in-app toggle if available.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>7) Children</h2>
      <p>PadelScore is not directed to children under 13. If you believe a child has provided personal data, please contact us so we can delete it.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>8) Security</h2>
      <p>We use industry-standard technical and organizational measures, including Firebase security features and platform protections. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure; please use strong device security and keep your account credentials confidential.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>9) Changes to this policy</h2>
      <p>We may update this policy to reflect changes in features or regulations. We will post the new version here and update the “Last updated” date above. Significant changes may be communicated in-app.</p>
